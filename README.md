# Online-Student-Portal


In this project, we aim to design a database management system to store 
information on an Online students’ portal. This will manage the students’ 
information during the whole semester. 
The database stores unique log in information for each student which helps them to 
access the portal. Every student may provide their profile information which 
includes Name, roll number, current course pursued by them. The database also 
includes the information about the subject opted by individual student. This may 
also include the credits as well the useful materials the students may require for 
their academics. 

# Tables:
- Student
- Project
- Attendance
